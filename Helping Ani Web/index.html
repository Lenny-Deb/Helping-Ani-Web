                    HELPING ANI is an psychological-horror game, where you play as Hajime, a boy who has to take something to his girlfriend, Ani. But be careful, the forest will be full of traps and strange creatures!<br><br>

                    Talk to the "people" you'll find in the vast forest, solve puzzles and know the real history...<br><br>
                    
                    With some hand-drawn drawings, Helping Ani tells a sad and raw history, with dynamic easter eggs and jumpscares, so don't let your guard down!<br><br>
